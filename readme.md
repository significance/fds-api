## FDS-API

### Endpoint:

`https://api.fairdatasociety.org/`

### Methods:

#### CreateAccount / Get Token

Submit a request for an api token here - this will be rate limited.

You MUST retain your token - this is the key to decode the wallet file we store for you.

WE CAN NOT RECOVER THIS KEY AS WE DO NOT KEEP A RECORD OF IT!

Note - this can take a while!

//server tries to create new account, if succesfull, a token is created for the user to use to access the api
